## Introduction

Handling missing values is a crucial step in data preprocessing. Missing values can significantly affect the performance of machine learning models if not handled properly. This project aims to provide a clear understanding of how to detect and visualize missing values in a dataset.

## Project Overview

The `loan.csv` dataset contains various features related to loan applications. The primary objective of this project is to identify and visualize the missing values in this dataset. By doing so, we can decide on the best strategies for handling these missing values in subsequent data preprocessing steps.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to clone the repository, install the necessary packages, and ensure Jupyter Notebook is set up. Here are the steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    - You can clone the repository using the command:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/Keerthana-B-15/Missing-Value-Analysis-Using-ML.git
        ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    - Change your current working directory to the project directory:
        ```bash
        cd Missing-Value-Analysis-Using-ML
        ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
    - The project requires `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`. You can install these packages using pip:
        ```bash
        pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
        ```

4. **Install Jupyter Notebook:**
    - If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can install it using pip:
        ```bash
        pip install notebook
        ```

## Usage

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    - Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Start Jupyter Notebook by running:
        ```bash
        jupyter notebook
        ```

2. **Open the notebook:**
    - In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the project directory and open the notebook file `loan_analysis.ipynb`.

### Notebook Workflow

The Jupyter Notebook contains the following sections:

1. **Loading the Dataset:**
    - This section covers how to load the `loan.csv` dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

2. **Inspecting the Dataset:**
    - Here, you will inspect the first few rows and the shape of the dataset to understand its structure.

3. **Identifying Missing Values:**
    - This section involves calculating the total number of missing values, the number of non-missing values, and the percentage of missing values in the dataset.

4. **Analyzing Missing Values:**
    - You will analyze the distribution of missing values across different columns and calculate the percentage of missing values per column.

5. **Visualizing Missing Values:**
    - This section uses a heatmap to visualize the missing values in the dataset, providing a clear visual representation of where the missing data is located.

## Data Analysis Steps

### 1. Loading the Dataset
The dataset is read into a pandas DataFrame. This step is essential for any data analysis project as it sets the foundation for subsequent operations.

### 2. Inspecting the Dataset
Understanding the structure of the dataset is crucial. We inspect the first few rows to get a sense of the data and check the shape of the dataset to know the number of rows and columns.

### 3. Identifying Missing Values
Identifying missing values involves several steps:
- **Total Missing Values:** Calculate the total number of missing values in the dataset.
- **Non-Missing Values:** Determine the number of non-missing values.
- **Percentage of Missing Values:** Compute the percentage of missing values in the entire dataset and per column.

### 4. Analyzing Missing Values
Understanding the distribution of missing values is key to determining the appropriate handling strategy. We analyze the number of missing values in each column and their respective percentages.

## Visualization

### Visualizing Missing Values with a Heatmap
A heatmap is a powerful tool for visualizing missing values. It provides a clear and immediate visual representation of where the missing values are located within the dataset. This can help in identifying patterns or trends in the missing data, which might be crucial for deciding how to handle them.
